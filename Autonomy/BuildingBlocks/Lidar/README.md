### - what -
simple simulated LiDAR scanner <p>

### - how -
"casting" rays into a virtual environment and copmuting where these rays intersect obstacles
need to define: pose, field of view, angular resolution, range

### - libraries -
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/): creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations <p>
[numpy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/): scientific computing and provides support for multi-dimensional arrays <p>
[shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html): manipulation and analysis of planar geometirc objects<p>
