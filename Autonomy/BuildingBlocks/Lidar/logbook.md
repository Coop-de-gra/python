installed packeges within the venv in pycharm (matplotlib, numpy, shapely) <p>
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/): creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations <p>
[numpy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/): scientific computing and provides support for multi-dimensional arrays <p>
[shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html): manipulation and analysis of planar geometirc objects<p>

cool new feature - you can find any python file, select "open with IDLE" and have a cool one-off minimalist IDE and compilier <p>
~ heard its really good for testing and not having to make an entire package and what not <p>

found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tllz7Ox2B3g&ab_channel=HobbyCoding) on youtube with more or less what I would want to try and do <p>
thinking about it now, I should break these up into little projects instead of one huge one <p>
that way its easier to talk about, looks good on resume, reduce over whelming, better understanding <p>
so first, lets do everything in perfect conditions where there is 0 uncertanty (with eventually introducing uncertanty)<p>
the projects i would like to break it down into are: lidar sensor, path algorithm, mapping, PID controller, object detection, localization,
